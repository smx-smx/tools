Scripts to take the audio and video feeds from the Android [IP Webcam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam) application, and pipe them through RTSP.

There are some samples included to play the stream locally and to use the output with [obs-gstreamer](https://github.com/fzwoch/obs-gstreamer)
