[vbaudio cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) + gstreamer + [gstreamer-rtsp-server](https://github.com/GStreamer/gst-rtsp-server/blob/master/examples/test-launch.c) for exposing desktop audio through RTSP

I used this to stream audio from my Desktop PC to an Android smartphone in the other room, connected to speakers.
On the Android side, you can use any RTSP-capable player, like [MX Player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mxtech.videoplayer.ad)
